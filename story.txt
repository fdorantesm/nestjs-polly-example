Once upon a time, in a magical land of code, there were two babies developers named Timmy and Tammy. They were both very curious and loved to explore the world of programming.

One day, they decided to build a website together. They were so excited to work on this project that they stayed up all night and didn't even take their afternoon nap!

Timmy and Tammy worked hard to make the website look perfect. They added lots of fun colors and pictures of their favorite animals. They even made a special button that would make the website dance!

But as they were working, they encountered a problem. They couldn't figure out how to make the website play music. They tried everything they could think of, but nothing seemed to work.

Suddenly, they had an idea! They remembered that their favorite teddy bear, Teddy, always knew what to do when they were stuck. So they ran to Teddy and asked him for help.

Teddy listened carefully to their problem and then said, "Have you tried using the audio tag?" Timmy and Tammy had never heard of the audio tag before, but they decided to give it a try.

And it worked! The website was now playing beautiful music that made everyone in the magical land of code dance with joy.

Timmy and Tammy were so proud of themselves for solving the problem with Teddy's help. They learned that sometimes, it's okay to ask for help when you're stuck, and that even babies developers can create amazing things with a little bit of creativity and teamwork.

From that day on, Timmy and Tammy continued to explore the world of programming and built many more wonderful websites together. And whenever they encountered a problem, they knew that they could always turn to Teddy for help.
